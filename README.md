# MakeBook

MakeBook is an app for creating game-books. A game-book is a book that at the bottom of each page there are choices at the bottom that determine what happens next. The user can create their own game-book and can also read the books that others have created.

Each page is given an id on creation. To attach a page to a choice the user has to paste the id of the page to be attached in the box next to the box for the text of the choice itself.

It is made using Node.js, MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, JavaScript and SCSS. It is on port 4000.


# Future Updates

* More user friendly
* Instructions
* Secure route for the books being created so that only the author of the book may edit, delete and add to a book that they are creating.
* The profile page will show a list of all the books that the user has created
* The pages will be seperated by chapter so that once a book gets long it will be a lot easier to manage
